Plugins → Add Plugin → Upload Plugin → Install Now → Replace current with uploaded → Activate.

### After you activate 5.6.8

1. Confirm **Plugins** shows **Version 5.6.8**.
2. Open **Luxe Product Scout**.
3. Confirm **24/7 learning is ON**.
4. Click **Repair ALL Catalog Data + Recalculate** once so the **full catalog** scoreboard is stored (233 products, not 25).
5. Click **Run Full Catalog Audit** or **Run learning snapshot**. The board must show the full catalog, not a 25-product batch.
6. Leave the site running. WP-Cron learns **one product every 5 minutes**. The hourly snapshot refreshes averages **without replacing the catalog with a tiny batch**.

Your last 5.6.7 run scanned all **233** products. A later 25-product batch overwrote the board to 25/25. **5.6.8 stops that.** Tiny batches never replace the full-catalog scoreboard.

### 24/7 learning

| Cycle | What it does |
|---|---|
| Every 5 minutes | Repair + rescore **one** product. Log it. Never publishes. |
| Every hour | Read-only snapshot of stored scores for the **full catalog**. Updates the board averages. Does not import. |
| Repair next batch | Still 25 products for a manual catch-up. **Does not overwrite** the 233-product board. |
| Repair ALL / Full Audit | Only these (and the hourly snapshot) write the full catalog scoreboard. |

WP-Cron is kept alive on `init` / `shutdown` **without running repair on public page views**. If Hostinger has a real cron job, point it at `wp-cron.php` every 5 minutes.

### What scores 95–100

A product is 95–100 when it has **supported brand + ASIN + price + primary image** and is **not HOLD**. Missing ratings, seller, or warranty do **not** invent evidence and do **not** drop a valid product below 95.

- **Integrity 100** when a model signal is present.
- **Integrity 95** when the rest of the gate is met.
- Taxonomy leftovers are repaired. They **do not cap** a valid product at 94.
- Unknown brand, renewed, used, refurbished stay **HOLD** and stay below 95.
